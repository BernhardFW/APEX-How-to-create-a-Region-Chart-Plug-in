Building plug-ins in Oracle APEX is not that difficult. This application will take you by the hand and show you step by step how to build an APEX plug-in.

The problem:

Oracle APEX has very fancy charts, but you want to have a chart that you can download as an image. This problem will be solved once without a plug-in and then with a plug-in. The individual plug-ins have different levels of implementation.
Have a look at the code and understand how easy it is to build a plug-in.
